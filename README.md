🌟 Project Goal: Address the issue of high prices for locally produced goods in Sri Lanka's marketplace.

📈 Problem Statement
Commodities like fruits, vegetables, eggs, and rice have seen a significant price increase. This surge is mainly due to intermediaries controlling market dynamics, leading to a skewed profit distribution:

Farmers receive low compensation.
Consumers pay inflated prices.
Intermediaries earn disproportionately high profits.
This disrupts the agricultural supply chain's equilibrium.

🛠️ Objectives
💰 Fair Pricing Mechanisms: Ensure farmers receive fair compensation and customers have access to reasonably priced goods.
🔄 Regulate Intermediary Profits: Align intermediary profits with their contributions to the value chain.
🔍 Promote Transparency and Accountability: Implement policy interventions that foster transparency and accountability in pricing structures.
📈 Enhance Market Access: Develop initiatives to improve market access for both producers and consumers, fostering a more inclusive and sustainable economic landscape.
🤝 Collaborative Efforts

Achieving these objectives requires collaboration among:

🏛️ Government Bodies
🏢 Industry Players
🌱 Grassroots Organizations

By addressing pricing disparities and promoting fairness, transparency, and efficiency throughout the agricultural supply chain, we can create a more equitable marketplace that supports long-term prosperity for all stakeholders.
